= RDiscount - Discount Markdown For Ruby

Discount is an implementation of John Gruber's Markdown markup
language in C. It implements all of the language as described in
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>
and passes the Markdown test suite at
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/MarkdownTest_1.0.zip>

Discount was developed by
{David Loren Parsons}[http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc]. The
RDiscount extension was developed by {Ryan Tomayko}[http://tomayko.com/].

== Installation, Hacking

RDiscount Gem releases are published to RubyForge and can be installed as
follows:

  $ [sudo] gem install rdiscount

The RDiscount sources are available via Git:

  $ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount.git
  $ cd rdiscount
  $ rake --tasks

For more information, see:

== Usage

RDiscount implements the basic protocol popularized by RedCloth and adopted
by BlueCloth:

  require 'rdiscount'
  markdown = RDiscount.new("Hello World!")
  puts markdown.to_html

Inject RDiscount into your BlueCloth-using code by replacing your bluecloth
require statements with the following:

  begin
    require 'rdiscount'
    BlueCloth = RDiscount
  rescue LoadError
    require 'bluecloth'
  end

== License

Discount is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work. RDiscount adopts Discount's license
verbatim. See the file COPYING for more information.
