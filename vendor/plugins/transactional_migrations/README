= Transactional Migrations

Transactional Migrations is a plugin that ensures your migration scripts--both 
up and down--run within a transaction. When used in conjunction with a
database that supports transactional Data Definition Language (DDL)--such as
PostgreSQL--this ensures that if any statement within your migration script
fails, the entire script is rolled-back.

Over and above installing the plugin, no further action is required for the
transactions to take effect.
