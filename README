== N.A.Q. (Never Asked Questions)

Q. Why is a tiny app like Quiki written in big bulky Rails and not in something *quick* like Sinatra/Merb/Raw Machine Code?

A. Because Rails is so easy to extend and add to and can take advantage of all the wonderful plugins! (Quiki is built upon the backs of many previous laborers).
